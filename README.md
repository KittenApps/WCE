# Wholesome Club Extensions (WCE)

*this BC addon started as a fork of the old 5.8 versions of FBC*

## Installation

1. Install a users script manager like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/#installation) (recommended, open source) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (closed source, includes tracking) or for i(Pad)OS use something like [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/userscripts/id1463298887)
2. Install one of the following addon loaders by opening the link and confirming the installation:
    * [WCE with FUSAM loader](https://wce.netlify.app/wce-fusam-loader.user.js) (recommended): make sure to remove the old FUSAM loader
    * [WCE loader](https://wce.netlify.app/wce-loader.user.js) (without FUSAM): make sure you still load [FUSAM following their introductions](https://sidiousious.gitlab.io/bc-addon-loader/)
3. Make sure that the old FBC version isn't loaded through FUSAM anymore
